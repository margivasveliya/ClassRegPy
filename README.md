--> Iris Flower Classification with Decision Trees & Random Forests

Welcome!  
This project is a hands-on exploration of machine learning models using the classic Iris flower dataset. We’ll walk through how to train, visualize, and evaluate:

- A full-depth decision tree
- A shallow decision tree (limited depth)
- A random forest classifier

Along the way, we'll compare their performance, visualize feature importance, and even generate a pretty PDF of the decision tree .

--> What’s Inside

- main.py – The Python script with all the ML code.
- full_decision_tree.pdf – A visual of the decision tree (generated when you run the script).
- README.md – This file, telling you what’s going on.

---

--> What You’ll Need

Before running the script, make sure you have the following installed:

pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn graphviz

> Note: To generate the decision tree PDF, you also need the [Graphviz software](https://graphviz.org/download/). After installing, make sure it’s added to your system PATH so Python can find it.

You’ll see:
- Printed model accuracy in the terminal
- A decision tree saved as `full_decision_tree.pdf`
- A feature importance chart popping up in a window
